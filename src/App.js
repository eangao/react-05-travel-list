//     //     Now the next question
//     // is how do we actually get this data from the form
//     // into this event handler, right?
//     // Because of course the goal
//     // is to do something with this data.
//     // So with this quantity and with this item description.
//     // Well there are multiple ways of doing so.
//     // So we could get that data right from the event object.
//     // So let's just see,
//     // we could like log this event to the console.
//     // So let's see what happens.
//     // So here we get this synthetic base event,
//     // and we will talk about
//     // what this synthetic event is a bit later.
//     // But you see that here we get the target.
//     // So basically the element on which the event was fired.
//     // And then there we have, for example,
//     // the input on which we can see the value.
//     // So test is exactly what we have here, right?
//     // However in React, we usually don't do this.
//     // Instead, we use something called controlled elements.
//     // But that's a topic for a whole new video.
//     // And so let's now take a break and come back in a second.
//     console.log(e);
//   }

//   return (
//     <form className="add-form" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
//       <h3>What do you need for your üòç trip? </h3>
//       <select>
//         {/* <option value={1}>1</option>
//         <option value={2}>2</option>
//         <option value={3}>3</option> */}

//         {/* we don't want to write these 20 options over there by hand,
//           right?
//           So instead what we do is to, inside of JavaScript,
//           we will create an array with the numbers from one to 20,
//           and then we will loop over that array,
//           and basically create a list of option elements.
//           So let's do that, and we will use a nice trick,
//           which is called array.from.
//           And it's not really important how this function works.
//           So let's just follow this here.
//           And actually, we will do this all the time in React.
//           So this trick is actually quite important.
//           So as a first parameter here,
//           we can pass in an object with a length property,
//           and set that to 20.

//           So that will then create an empty array with 20 elements.
//           And then as a second part,
//           we can pass in basically something like a map function.
//           So that will receive as a first argument,
//           the current value, and as a second argument, the index.
//           And so here, we are only interested in that index,
//           because we will now return that index,
//           which starts at zero plus one.
//           And so then we get an array, which goes from one to 20.
//           And if we want it,
//           we could just grab this piece of code right here,
//           and run it inside of our console, make it a bit bigger.
//           And yeah, indeed we are missing the key somewhere there,
//           but nevermind, we will fix that in a minute.
//           And so indeed here, we get that array from one to 20.
//           All right.

//           And now all we need to do, is to again use the map method,
//           and loop over this
//           to create our list of these option elements.
//           So again, specifying the value,
//           and now that value is simply numb and we need the key.
//           And that key is also numb.
//           So remember how that when we render a list,
//           we need to give each of the elements a unique key.
//           So the number here is of course, unique.
//           And then here also numb.
//           So give that a safe,
//           which makes this a little bit more legible.
//           And so this option
//           is basically just exactly what we had before here manually.
//           But now we create that dynamically here,
//           automatically from zero to 20.
//           So there it is. */}

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Controlled Elements
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Let's now learn about yet another
// fundamental React concept which is controlled elements.
// So let's take a look what they are
// and how we use controlled elements
// when working with forms in React.
// So to start, what we need to understand is that by default
// these input fields like this input and also this select
// they maintain their own state inside the DOM.
// So basically inside the HTML element itself.
// Now this makes it hard to read their values
// and it also leaves this state right here in the DOM
// which for many reasons is not ideal.
// So in React, we usually like to keep all this state
// in just one central place.
// So inside the React application and not inside the DOM.
// And so in order to do that we use a technique
// called controlled elements.
// And so with this technique
// it is React who controls and owns the state
// of these input fields and no longer the DOM.
// So since we want to now keep this data
// inside the application, what that means
// is that we need some state, right?
// Because that form data of course changes over time
// and we also want to maintain our application
// in sync with it.

const initialItems = [
  { id: 1, description: "Passports", quantity: 2, packed: false },
  { id: 2, description: "Socks", quantity: 12, packed: true },
  { id: 3, description: "Charger", quantity: 12, packed: false },
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Logo />
      <Form />
      <PackingList />
      <Stats />
    </div>
  );
}

function Logo() {
  return <h1>üå¥ Far Away üíº</h1>;
}

function Form() {
  //   So in order to implement the controlled elements technique,
  // we follow three steps.
  // First we create a piece of state.
  // So let's start with that
  // and we will start here with this actual input element.
  // So with this text field right there.
  const [description, setDescription] = useState("");

  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    if (!description) return;

    // And then we also need an ID.
    // Now we could use some library here to generate that ID
    // but let's do it quick and dirty here, just with date.now.
    // So that should just work here in this case.
    const newItem = { description, quantity, packed: false, id: Date.now() };
    console.log(newItem);
    //     So with this we learned how we get now this data
    // out of the form.

    //     And now finally, usually when we submit a form
    // then afterwards, once that submission is done
    // the form should go back to its initial state.
    // So let's also do that.
    // And for that we can simply use our setter functions, right?
    // And so that's the beauty
    // of React being in charge of the form
    // because now all we have to do is to update the state
    // and then this enables React to automatically keep this state
    // in sync with these form elements.
    // So basically that's the whole idea
    // of the controlled elements.
    setDescription("");
    setQuantity(1);

    //     So that worked really, really nicely.
    // So this form is now a lot more real world.
    // It's back to its initial state.
    // And then down here we get the data.
    // But now what do we do with this data?
    // So at some point we will want to actually render
    // this new object here into the user interface.
    // So right here into this packing list, right?
    // So how do you think we will do that?
    // So how can we get this new state?
    // So basically this new object that we just created
    // into this list.
    // And just as a reminder, this list,
    // well, it's even easier to see in the componentry.
    // So we have the form, and here is the list.
    // So we want to get the data from this form
    // into this packing list right here.
    // So do you think that we could do that with props?
    // Well, not really, right?
    // Because these are sibling components.
    // The form is not a parent component of the packing list
    // and therefore we cannot pass props from form
    // into the packing list, right?
    // So because data can only flow down the tree
    // but not up or sideways.
    // So that was one of the important things
    // that we learned about props, remember that?
    // So therefore, if we cannot use props in a simple way
    // we need to find another solution.
    // And so this is where we really need to start
    // thinking more about state and state management.
    // But since this is so important as a React developer,
    // I created an entire separate section
    // about thinking in React and that section is up next.
    // So what we're gonna do now is to take a break
    // in this application and finish this section
    // with a brief summary and a challenge to consolidate
    // our knowledge about how to use state in React.
    // And then after that, we will come back
    // here to this application
    // and then we will really make it work.
    // So then we will be able to pass data
    // basically from the form into the list.
    // So that's going to be a lot of fun.
    // So make sure to finish this section
    // and then right afterwards,
    // let's keep going with this application.
  }

  //   So just to quickly recap,
  // the technique of controlled elements
  // basically consists of three steps.
  // So we define a piece of state, like this description here
  // then we use that piece of state
  // on the element that we want to control.
  // So we basically force the element to always take the value
  // of this state variable.
  // And then finally, of course
  // we need to update that state variable.
  // And we do so here with the on change handler
  // where we then set the description
  // to the current value of that input field.
  // And so with this, it is now this component.
  // So basically it's React who is in charge
  // of the state and really of the entire element.
  // And so that's the reason why this technique
  // is called controlled element.

        // and by the way, this value is coming directly

      string that is currently in this input field, which will then re-render

      of description will get placed there as the value. So we always need both
